Harald In Space is one of my Unity game projects that is currently on hold. In the game, a group of 1-4 players are set on a space station and are to perform a mission together. They must sneak their way through the level and avoid getting caught in their mission. The game has a simplistic low-poly style but still has personality.

You can download the latest build of the game [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z3cs4fst445f6w7/HaraldInSpace-Build.zip?dl=1) if you want to. I'm not sure if you will be able to play with other players, though. If you want to try anyway, don't forget to port-forward as the steam-join doesn't work 95% of the time.

We also made a Spotify playlist to set the musical feel of the game.
