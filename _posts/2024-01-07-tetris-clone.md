This is an old Tetris copy I created during my first year of High School, or the equivalent of the Swedish "Gymnasium," when I was 16 years old. I believe I was the only one in the class who had any experience with Unity or C# at the time, despite studying game programming that year. It's safe to say that I was the most proficient in it throughout the entire class. Even our teacher had minimal experience with Unity.
