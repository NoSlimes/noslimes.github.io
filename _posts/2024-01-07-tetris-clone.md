This is an old Tetris copy I created during my first year of High School, or the equivalent of the Swedish "Gymnasium," when I was 16 years old. I believe I was one of the only ones in the class who had any experience with Unity or C# at the time, despite us all studying game programming that year. Even our teacher had very minimal experience with Unity. He just threw us video "tutorial" after video tutorial, didn't even teach us the basics of programming.
