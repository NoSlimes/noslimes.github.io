OneMouse is a game we created in our class "Digitalt Skapande 2," which translates to "Digital Creating 2" in English. The goal of the game is to navigate a maze while being hunted by a "big fat dammr√•tta." It's set under a bed, adding complexity to the maze with Legos and other obstacles. Since I'm studying game graphics, I wasn't supposed to do much programming for this game. However, I ended up contributing some programming assistance to the group.
