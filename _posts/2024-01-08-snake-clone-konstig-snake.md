This snake clone is a game I made following a class i attended in _"game development"_ when I was 14 or something. The game is made using ActionScript in like Adobe Animate or something of the like. We had some strange teacher the school i was attending the class in had hired just for that class, and he was the sole reason for us using some Adobe program not suited for game development instead of something like Unity or Unreal Engine, or even Scratch for that matter. Honestly think we'd gotten more practical knowledge out of scratch than whatever we were using.

If I learned something during that semester it was a little about arrays perhaps, as we made some sort of 2-dimensional array for building the map. Something like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="center">1</td>

    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="center">1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>

    <td align="center">1</td>
  </tr>
