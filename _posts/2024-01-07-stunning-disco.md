Stunning Disco is a game project created as a group project during the "Digitalt Skapande 2" (Digital Creating 2) class. In the game, two players control characters and compete against each other to finish key combinations. It bears some resemblance to Friday Night Funkin'. If we had progressed further, the player in the lead would have pushed the crowd surrounding the platforms the players were standing on more towards the other player, eventually throwing them off their platform.
