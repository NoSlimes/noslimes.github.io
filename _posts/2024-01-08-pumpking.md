PumpKing is a game I've been working on since halloween 2023. The game is about growing and throwing pumpkins at ghosts, all while the ghosts tries to destroy (or _"eat"_) your pumpkins before you manage to harvest them all.

The game is still pretty early on in it's development as I've overwhelmed myself a bit with multiple semi-large projects at the same time. As of writing this I'm working on both "[Plågorna](/_posts/2024-01-07-hexgame.md)" and this game at the same time. I've also got a few other smaller projects and school at the same time.

I will update this post with a download, or at least a few images, when I get closer to being finished with the game or just when I get the time.

>Currently, I sadly do not have a build of this game available for download.
