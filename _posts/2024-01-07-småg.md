Småg is a character created by my girlfriend and me in 2021. It resembles some sort of a bird with wiggly legs and vibrant colors. Surprisingly, the Småg became very popular among the first-year students who started studying at LBS in the fall of 2022. The Småg is now part of the school's lore. We also created a sheet with step-by-step instructions on how to structure a basic Småg because, as we know, they come in many forms.
