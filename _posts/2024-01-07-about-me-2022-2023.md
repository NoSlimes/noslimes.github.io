## Who Am I?

My name is Elias, and I'm a 18-year-old guy from Sweden. Currently exploring various creative and technical fields, I love to learn new things. I'm studying game graphics at LBS Kreativa Gymnasium.

## My Passions

My two biggest passions right now are 3D modeling and programming. I mainly work in C# and Unity, always striving to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.

## My Background

I grew up in a small village in Sweden, always having an interest in computers and technology. I started programming in my early teens but stopped due to laziness. Picking it up again a few years ago, I've been hooked ever since. Over the years, I've experimented with various programming languages and technologies, focusing on creating fun and interactive experiences for others.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm working on several projects. One of my main focuses is creating 3D models and assets for games and applications. Additionally, I'm improving my skills in web development, particularly in frontend development using JavaScript and CSS – the main reason I've decided to code this website by myself.

## Other Interests

Aside from 3D modeling and programming, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies and TV shows, and listening to music. A big fan of sci-fi and fantasy, one of my favorite book/film series is Harry Potter. There's also a particular book, "Förvandlad" by Mårten Sanden, that stuck with me from my early school years.

## My Future Plans

After completing my studies at LBS Kreativa Gymnasium, I plan to apply to Future Games in Skellefteå to pursue a degree in game development. Future Games is one of the leading game development schools in Sweden, and I believe it will provide me with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in this industry.

Over the next year, I plan to continue honing my skills in programming and 3D modeling to prepare for my studies at Future Games. Excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of game development!
