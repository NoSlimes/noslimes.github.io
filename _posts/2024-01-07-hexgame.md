HexGame is a small test project I made when I wanted to create a simple strategy game. The game consists of a map made up of hexagons, hence the name of the game. It would have been a pretty basic game where the player could select tiles to place objects on. Different objects would have different costs and effects. Additionally, there would be some tiles with "occult" buildings on them, and these buildings would have effects that could either be beneficial or give the player a disadvantage. I hope to continue working on the game in the future when I have more time to dedicate to my projects.

>Currently, I sadly do not have a build of this game available for download.
