This is a simulated Rube Goldberg machine created for an animation class in the fall of 2021, when I was just beginning to use 3D modeling software. While I'm satisfied with the result, I recognize that I could have done it better today, demonstrating my development since I started. Additionally, I might have made it slightly more advanced than the class requested â€“ I went the extra mile by rendering the entire animation.

Here's a video of the Rube Goldberg machine:
