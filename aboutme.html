    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Elias and I'm a 19-year-old guy from Sweden. I'm currently exploring various creative and
            technical fields, and I love to learn new things. I finished studying game graphics at LBS Kreativa
            Gymnasium in the spring of 2023, where I had been studying for the last 3 years. In the fall of 2023, 
            I began studying at the Bible school "Mariannelunds Folkhögskola"</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Passions</h2>
        <p>My two biggest passions right now are 3D modeling and programming. I mainly work in C# and Unity, and I'm
            always striving to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a small village in Sweden, and I've always had an interest in computers and technology. I
            started programming in my early teens but soon stopped since I was too lazy to learn. I picked it up again a
            few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. Over the years, I've experimented with various programming
            languages and technologies, but my focus has always been on creating fun and interactive experiences for
            others.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
        <p>Right now, I'm working on a few different projects. One of my main focuses is creating 3D models and assets
            for my games and other applications, or just for practice. I'm also working on improving my skills in web
            development, particularly in frontend development using JavaScript and CSS, the main reason I've decided to
            code this website by myself.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Other Interests</h2>
        <p>Aside from 3D modeling and programming, I also enjoy playing video games, watching movies and TV shows, and
            listening to music. I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy. One of my favourite book/film series is Harry
            Potter, the wizarding world is one I can truly fantasize myself into.
            <br>
            <br>
            There was also that one book I read in
            like.. third or fourth grade, "Förvandlad", written by the author "Mårten Sanden". For some reason that book stuck to
            me and I kept on rereading it. It was something about it that I really liked. Maybe I'm getting a little sidetracked right
            now, heh..
        </p>
        <h2>My Future Plans</h2>
        <p>In 2024 I plan to apply to Future Games in Skellefteå to
            pursue a degree in game development. Future Games is one of the leading game development schools in Sweden,
            and I believe it will provide me with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in this industry.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the next year, I plan to continue honing my skills in programming and 3D modeling to prepare for my
            studies at Future Games. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of game development!
