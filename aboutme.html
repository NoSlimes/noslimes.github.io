        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Elias and I'm a 19-year-old guy from Sweden. I'm currently exploring various creative and
            technical fields, and I love to learn new things. I'm currently studying game graphics at LBS Kreativa
            Gymnasium.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Passions</h2>
        <p>My two biggest passions right now are 3D modeling and programming. I mainly work in C# and Unity, and I'm
            always striving to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a small village in Sweden, and I've always had an interest in computers and technology. I
            started programming in my early teens but soon stopped since I was too lazy to learn. I picked it up again a
            few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. Over the years, I've experimented with various programming
            languages and technologies, but my focus has always been on creating fun and interactive experiences for
            others.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
        <p>Right now, I'm working on a few different projects. One of my main focuses is creating 3D models and assets
            for my games and other applications, or just for practice. I'm also working on improving my skills in web
            development, particularly in frontend development using JavaScript and CSS, the main reason I've decided to
            code this website by myself.</p>
        <br>
