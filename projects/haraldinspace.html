        <p>Harald In Space is one of my Unity game projects that are currently on hold. In the game, a group of 1-4
            players are set on a space station and are to peform
            an mission together. They must sneak their way through the level and avoid getting caught in their mission.
            The game has a simplistic low-poly style but still has personality.
