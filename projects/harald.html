        <p>Harald is a game that I've been working on from now and then for over 2 years at this point. Harald is a
            horror game set deep in the swedish woods. You, a normal civilian
            find yourself stranded in this strange forest as you suddenly crash your car. You look around and see that
            there's a trail with lights a bit ahead of you. What happens if you follow
            the road is up for you to tell.

            I'm currently working on Harald together with my girlfriend as a commision for the LBS Game Awards that's
            hosted by my school.
