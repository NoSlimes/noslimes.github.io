            Harald is a game that I've been working on from now and then for over 2 years at this point (2023). I'm
            currently working on Harald together with my girlfriend as a commision for the LBS Game Awards that's
            hosted by my school.
            <br><br>
            Harald is a horror game set deep in the swedish woods. You, a normal civilian find yourself stranded in this
            strange
            forest as you suddenly crash your car. You look around and see that
            there's a trail with lights a bit ahead of you. What happens if you follow
            the road is up for you to tell.
            <br><br>
            Since me and my girlfriend picked up the game again we've been working on improving the game in pretty much
            all ways. We've made new level designs for both outdoor and indoor scenes. The original plan of the game
            was just to have an interior, but I added an exterior when I worked on the game during 2022 and we've kept
            that idea. We also decided to switch over to Unity's HD render pipeline, as it will make it easier for us
            to get the game looking the way we want. It allows for much better control over lighting right out of the
            box, with dynamic skies and volumetric clouds and fog.
            <br><br>
            Since I started working on the game in 2020, I've become much better at both programming and using the tools
            provided by Unity. When we started working on it for the LBS Game Awards I realised how much of the game I
            would have to rewrite to be able to use it efficiently. Safe to say the code was a mess and I've been
            working on making it more modular and easier to read.
            <br><br>
            Other than the technical stuff I've also been working on improving the overall visuals. The trees I made
            in 2022 have been remade, with a much smaller poly count and a much better looking result. I watched one of <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mediagabbitt">Grant Abbit's</a> tutorials on how to make low-poly,
            fairly realistic, trees in Blender and took
            a bit of inspiration from that. The main problem I had before was the leaves but I found out about leaf
            planes/leaf plates, which made the whole process much easeier with much fewer vertices there as well.
